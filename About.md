# What is PDK?

The Puppet Development Kit (PDK) is an All-In-One set of tools for developing and testing Puppet modules.

PDK includes a bundled version of Ruby plus various gems and utilities required for creating and testing Puppet modules.

[PDK was announced](https://puppet.com/blog/develop-modules-faster-new-puppet-development-kit) in August of 2017 with
the goal of making it easier to build high-quality Puppet modules that follow best practices and use the available
testing frameworks to avoid deploying bad code to live infrastructure.
